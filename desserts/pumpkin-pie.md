## Ingredients

### Pie Crust
- `1-1/3 c` all-purpose flour
- `1/2 tsp` salt
- `1/2 c` shortening
- `3-1/2 tbsp` cold water

### Filling
- `2 c` mashed, cooked pumpkin
- `12 fl oz` (1 can) evaporated milk
- `3/4 c` packed brown sugar
- `1/2 tsp` ground cinnamon
- `1/2 tsp` ground ginger
- `1/2 tsp` ground nutmeg
- `1/2 tsp` salt
- 2 eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons). Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together.
3. With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan.
4. In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. Pour into a prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean.
